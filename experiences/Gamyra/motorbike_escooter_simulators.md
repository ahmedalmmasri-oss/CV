# Gamyra - Motorbike & E-Scooter Simulator Development

## Summary
Led procurement, R&D, and delivery of Gamyra's first motorbike and e-scooter simulators for Qatar University, managing tight budgets and aggressive 6-month timeline. Overcame significant technical challenges with buggy simulation software while maintaining team morale through extended development period. Successfully navigated complex government processes to cancel vehicle registration for brand-new motorbike, demonstrating creative problem-solving in bureaucratic environments.

## Achievements

### Strategic Procurement Management
- **Problem:** 6-month timeline and limited budget required careful procurement planning to avoid R&D delays while managing cash flow constraints.
- **What I Did:** Led procurement strategy balancing cost, timeline, and quality. Distributed costs across payment stages ensuring development continued without supply shortages between payments. Sourced components internationally (Europe, North America) when local availability was limited. Managed customs clearance for shipped items requiring direct approval for release.
- **Impact:** Maintained continuous R&D progress despite budget constraints. Streamlined budget execution prevented development stoppages, keeping project on track toward delivery deadlines.

### Government Process Navigation - Vehicle Registration
- **Problem:** Brand-new motorbike needed vehicle registration cancelled for indoor simulator use, but government had no standard process for cancelling registration on latest-model new vehicles (only old vehicles scheduled for scrapping).
- **What I Did:** Spent several working days navigating multiple government departments explaining unique requirement. Provided official letter stamped by Gamyra justifying registration cancellation for research project. Submitted rendering images as evidence of simulator application. Persistently followed up across departments until securing unprecedented approval.
- **Impact:** Overcame bureaucratic obstacle that could have blocked entire project. Demonstrated resourcefulness and persistence in government relations, securing approval for process that didn't officially exist.

### R&D Leadership Through Technical Challenges
- **Problem:** First-time development of motorbike and e-scooter simulators using simulation software with significant bugs and quality issues extended timeline from 6 months to 9+ months.
- **What I Did:** Supported R&D through scenario development, quality assurance, bug testing and fixes, performance optimization, calibration, and comprehensive testing. Coordinated with simulation software supplier on bug reports and workarounds. Managed client expectations regarding delays caused by third-party software limitations.
- **Impact:** Maintained project momentum despite unforeseen technical obstacles. E-scooter simulator reached final delivery demo stage; motorbike simulator achieved 80% completion. Protected client relationship through transparent communication about challenges.

### Team Morale & Leadership
- **Problem:** Extended timeline, persistent technical challenges, and pressure to meet requirements before deadline caused team burnout and low morale.
- **What I Did:** Focused on team well-being through fun conversations, team breakfasts/lunches together, and after-work social activities. Maintained positive atmosphere while acknowledging challenges. Balanced deadline pressure with genuine concern for team members' mental health and work-life balance.
- **Impact:** Preserved team cohesion and motivation through difficult development period. Prevented attrition and maintained quality despite frustration with buggy software. Team remained committed to project success.

### Quality Assurance & Performance Optimization
- **Problem:** Simulators needed to meet research-grade standards for vehicle dynamics, visual fidelity, and responsiveness despite software limitations.
- **What I Did:** Led systematic performance testing and optimization efforts. Calibrated vehicle dynamics to match real-world physics for both motorbike and e-scooter. Tested responsiveness and identified performance bottlenecks. Created comprehensive documentation for client handover.
- **Impact:** Delivered simulators meeting Qatar University's research standards despite challenging software foundation. Documentation enabled researchers to understand system capabilities and limitations.

### Client Delivery Management
- **Problem:** Client needed confidence that delivery would eventually succeed despite extended timeline.
- **What I Did:** Conducted delivery demonstration for e-scooter simulator with client. Collected feedback and communicated requirements to team for final adjustments. Maintained transparent communication on motorbike simulator progress (80% complete).
- **Impact:** Maintained client trust through transparent progress updates and responsive feedback incorporation. Positioned for successful final delivery and potential future simulator projects.

### Technology Advancement
- **Problem:** Staying current with simulation software developments was critical for maximizing product capabilities and identifying new business opportunities.
- **What I Did:** Attended simulation software supplier conferences learning about latest features and releases. Applied new knowledge to current project and identified opportunities to sell updates/features to existing clients.
- **Impact:** Ensured Gamyra's simulators leveraged cutting-edge capabilities. Identified upsell opportunities for existing client base, creating additional revenue streams from installed base.

## Project Context
Qatar University commissioned motorbike and e-scooter simulators as expansion of successful driving simulator research program. These new platforms enable research into two-wheeled vehicle safety, a growing concern as micro-mobility solutions proliferate in urban Qatar.

## Key Challenges Overcome
- Government vehicle registration cancellation for brand-new vehicle (unprecedented approval)
- International procurement across multiple regions with customs coordination
- Buggy simulation software requiring extensive workarounds
- 50% timeline extension (6 months â†’ 9 months) while maintaining client relationship
- Team morale management during extended challenging development period
- Budget constraints requiring strategic cost phasing

## Current Status
- E-scooter simulator: Final delivery demonstration completed, incorporating client feedback
- Motorbike simulator: 80% complete, progressing toward delivery
- Client relationship: Maintained through transparent communication and quality focus
