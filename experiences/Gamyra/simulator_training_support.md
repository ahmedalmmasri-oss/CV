# Gamyra - Simulator Training & User Support

## Summary
Enabled Qatar University researchers to independently conduct studies by providing comprehensive training on simulator operation, scenario development, and data collection. Coordinated technical support with development teams ensuring timely resolution of researcher issues, supporting multiple Masters and PhD research projects across 4+ years.

## Achievements

### Researcher Training Program Development
- **Problem:** Qatar University researchers (Masters and PhD students) needed to independently create custom scenarios, operate simulators, and collect research data without ongoing Gamyra involvement for every study.
- **What I Did:** Developed comprehensive training curriculum covering simulator operation fundamentals, scenario development using proprietary scripting tools, and research data collection workflows. Created hands-on exercises allowing researchers to practice skills in safe environment. Provided documentation and reference materials for self-service learning.
- **Impact:** Empowered 10+ researchers to independently conduct studies, accelerating research timelines and enabling Qatar University to maximize ROI on simulator investment. Training model became template for future research clients.

### Group Training Delivery
- **Problem:** New cohorts of researchers needed efficient onboarding without individual one-on-one training sessions.
- **What I Did:** Provided group training courses for cohorts of researchers, balancing lecture-style content delivery with hands-on practice. Adapted training pace to group needs, ensuring all participants achieved competency before course completion.
- **Impact:** Scaled training capacity to support growing research programs. Group format created peer learning opportunities and built research community around simulator platform.

### Advanced Technical Support
- **Problem:** Researchers encountered complex technical challenges beyond basic training scope, requiring specialized support to create advanced scenarios or extract specific data.
- **What I Did:** Provided ongoing advanced support when researchers faced issues with simulator platform or needed sophisticated scenario development. Diagnosed problems, identified solutions, and sometimes created custom implementations when researchers' needs exceeded their technical capabilities.
- **Impact:** Prevented research roadblocks that could delay thesis timelines or compromise study designs. Researchers knew reliable expert support was available, increasing confidence in choosing Gamyra simulators for complex studies.

### Cross-Functional Coordination
- **Problem:** Researcher needs sometimes required software modifications or bug fixes from Gamyra's development team.
- **What I Did:** Coordinated between researchers and development team to ensure timely support delivery. Translated researcher requirements into technical specifications. Prioritized support requests based on research timelines and impact. Managed expectations on both sides regarding feasibility and delivery timeframes.
- **Impact:** Created smooth support experience for researchers while protecting development team from constant interruptions. Ensured critical research deadlines were met through effective prioritization and stakeholder management.

### Documentation & Knowledge Base
- **Problem:** Repeated questions and common issues required ongoing support time that could be reduced through self-service resources.
- **What I Did:** Created documentation covering common operations, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. Updated materials based on recurring support questions. Provided researchers with searchable resources reducing dependency on live support.
- **Impact:** Reduced routine support burden while improving researcher independence. Documentation enabled researchers to solve common issues immediately rather than waiting for support responses.

### Continuous Learning Support
- **Problem:** Simulation platform received regular updates introducing new features researchers needed to understand.
- **What I Did:** Stayed current with SCANeR software releases by attending supplier conferences and studying release documentation. Evaluated new features for research applicability. Communicated relevant updates to research users and provided supplemental training when needed.
- **Impact:** Ensured researchers leveraged latest platform capabilities, improving research sophistication and keeping Qatar University's simulation capabilities at cutting edge.
