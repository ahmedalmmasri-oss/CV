# Gamyra - Simulator Maintenance & Technical Support

## Summary
Managed preventive and corrective maintenance across Gamyra's fleet of driving simulators deployed at multiple client sites throughout Qatar. Diagnosed and resolved complex technical issues, trained engineering teams, and maintained client satisfaction through responsive support and professional reporting.

## Achievements

### Multi-Site Maintenance Management
- **Problem:** Gamyra's simulators operated at multiple client locations (driving academies, Qatar University, Qatar Foundation, etc.) requiring coordinated maintenance scheduling without disrupting client operations.
- **What I Did:** Facilitated preventive maintenance schedules across all client sites. Coordinated with clients to schedule maintenance during low-impact periods. Performed systematic inspections of hardware, software, and mechanical components. Documented findings and maintained maintenance logs for each system.
- **Impact:** Maximized simulator uptime and reliability across client fleet. Prevented major failures through proactive maintenance, protecting client relationships and Gamyra's reputation for quality.

### Technical Diagnostics & Problem Resolution
- **Problem:** Simulators experienced diverse technical issues from hardware failures to software bugs, requiring rapid diagnosis and resolution to minimize client downtime.
- **What I Did:** Diagnosed simulator issues through systematic troubleshooting processes. Identified root causes spanning mechanical, electrical, and software domains. Coordinated with engineering teams to implement fixes. Tested solutions ensuring problems were fully resolved before returning systems to service.
- **Impact:** Maintained high system availability supporting thousands of training sessions annually. Developed troubleshooting expertise across Gamyra's simulator portfolio, becoming go-to resource for complex technical issues.

### Client Communication & Reporting
- **Problem:** Clients needed transparency on maintenance activities and confidence that their systems were properly maintained.
- **What I Did:** Prepared detailed maintenance reports for internal use tracking all service activities. Created concise maintenance summary reports for clients highlighting completed work, findings, and recommendations. Maintained professional communication explaining technical issues in accessible language.
- **Impact:** Built client trust through transparent reporting and professional communication. Clients understood system health and maintenance value, supporting contract renewals and ongoing relationships.

### Engineering Team Training
- **Problem:** Scaling maintenance operations required developing other engineers' diagnostic and repair capabilities.
- **What I Did:** Trained engineers on maintenance procedures, diagnostic techniques, and troubleshooting workflows. Created informal documentation and knowledge sharing. Supervised initial maintenance activities until engineers were confident and competent.
- **Impact:** Expanded Gamyra's maintenance capacity beyond single-person dependency. Enabled simultaneous maintenance across multiple sites and created redundancy for critical technical knowledge.

### Corrective Action Implementation
- **Problem:** Recurring issues required systematic corrective actions rather than repeated emergency fixes.
- **What I Did:** Analyzed patterns in maintenance data to identify recurring problems. Worked with engineering and development teams to implement design improvements and preventive measures. Updated maintenance procedures based on lessons learned.
- **Impact:** Reduced recurring failures and emergency service calls. Improved simulator reliability and reduced total maintenance costs through proactive corrections.

## Ongoing Responsibilities (2018-Present)
- Preventive maintenance scheduling and execution across client fleet
