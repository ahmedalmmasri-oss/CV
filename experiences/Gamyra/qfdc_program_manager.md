# Gamyra - QF Driving Club Program Manager

## Summary
Promoted to Program Manager to expand QF Driving Club beyond its initial scope, developing growth strategies and pursuing new sponsorship opportunities. Working directly with CEO on business development, proposal creation, and strategic client approaches to scale Qatar's leading road safety program.

## Achievements

### Strategic Program Expansion
- **Problem:** QF Driving Club successfully demonstrated impact (2,344 sessions 2022-2024) but needed strategic expansion to reach more students and secure additional funding sources.
- **What I Did:** Developed expansion strategies identifying new potential sponsors and client segments. Researched corporate social responsibility priorities of major Qatari organizations. Positioned QFDC as scalable model applicable beyond Qatar Foundation.
- **Impact:** Transitioned QFDC from single-sponsor, single-location program to multi-sponsor growth platform with potential extension to 2030 and expansion into broader Qatari educational ecosystem.

### Business Development & Proposal Creation
- **Problem:** Expanding program required compelling proposals demonstrating ROI and alignment with potential sponsors' CSR objectives.
- **What I Did:** Worked directly with Gamyra CEO to develop proposals targeting new sponsors. Gathered client requirements through meetings and research. Brainstormed business strategy and client approach tailored to each prospect's priorities (road safety leadership, youth engagement, Qatar National Vision 2030 alignment).
- **Impact:** Created pipeline of potential sponsors beyond initial funding source, reducing program dependency on single client and creating sustainable growth path.

### Client Relationship Management
- **Problem:** Maintaining existing sponsor relationships while pursuing new opportunities required diplomatic balance and continued value demonstration.
- **What I Did:** Attended client meetings presenting program performance data and impact stories. Gathered evolving requirements and incorporated feedback into program improvements. Maintained transparent communication on challenges and successes.
- **Impact:** Sustained existing sponsor confidence while building credibility for expansion discussions. Positioned Gamyra as trusted long-term partner rather than transactional vendor.

### Program Optimization
- **Problem:** Scaling QFDC required ensuring program efficiency and meeting client targets consistently.
- **What I Did:** Managed program operations to maintain efficient throughput rates. Coordinated with schools when participation lagged, ensuring students were sent in timely manner. Monitored KPIs and adjusted operations to meet sponsor expectations.
- **Impact:** Maintained program quality and efficiency while preparing infrastructure for scaled operations serving additional schools and sponsors.

## Current Focus (2025)
- Identifying and pursuing new corporate sponsors aligned with road safety mission
- Developing proposals for program expansion into additional Qatar Foundation schools and independent schools
- Working with CEO on strategic positioning for 2030 extension
- Optimizing operational efficiency to support scaled delivery
- Building business development pipeline for Gamyra's road safety programs

## Career Progression
Promotion from Project Engineer to Program Manager reflects expanded responsibility for strategic growth, business development, and program sustainability rather than purely operational execution.
