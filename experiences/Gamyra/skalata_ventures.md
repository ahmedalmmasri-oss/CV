# Gamyra - Business Strategy Development (Skalata Ventures Program)

## Summary
Selected as Gamyra's sole representative for an intensive 3-week accelerator program with Skalata Ventures in Melbourne, Australia. Completed 51 critical business deliverables spanning marketing, operations, legal, and financial planning. Networked with high-profile investors including Australian billionaire Paul Little, gaining strategic insights that influenced Gamyra's pivot toward scalable revenue models.

## Achievements

### Rapid Business Framework Development
- **Problem:** Gamyra needed to complete 51 comprehensive business deliverables to meet program milestones and unlock further investor support, with an aggressive deadline approaching.
- **What I Did:** Worked intensively with Gamyra's founders to develop 6 critical frameworks: UX map/User journey, Growth plan, Competitive landscape and insights, Org chart and skills gap matrix, Company and employee goals (KPIs/OKRs), Company and employee performance dashboard, and Position Description Template. Coordinated with team members on remaining 45 deliverables across marketing, sales, product, technology, legal, HR, and financial domains.
- **Impact:** Successfully completed all 51 deliverables on time, meeting program requirements and demonstrating organizational maturity to investors. Established foundational business systems still used by Gamyra today.

### Strategic Business Planning
- **Problem:** Gamyra needed comprehensive user journey mapping and competitive analysis to inform growth strategy.
- **What I Did:** Developed detailed UX maps showing customer touchpoints across Gamyra's product lines. Conducted competitive landscape analysis identifying key players in simulation training and educational technology sectors. Created org chart revealing skills gaps and hiring priorities.
- **Impact:** Provided strategic clarity on market positioning and organizational needs, informing hiring decisions and product development priorities for the following 2 years.

### Performance Management Systems
- **Problem:** Gamyra lacked formal systems for tracking company and employee performance against strategic objectives.
- **What I Did:** Developed KPI and OKR frameworks aligned with company vision. Created performance dashboards for monitoring progress. Designed position description templates standardizing role definitions and expectations.
- **Impact:** Enabled data-driven decision making and created accountability structures supporting Gamyra's growth from startup to established enterprise.

### High-Level Investor Engagement
- **Problem:** Gamyra's business model relied heavily on CSR funding for simulator programs, limiting scalability.
- **What I Did:** Presented Gamyra's business strategy to Paul Little (Australian billionaire investor and Skalata mentor). Discussed revenue models, market expansion opportunities, and scalability challenges.
- **Impact:** Received strategic advice to pivot toward scalable revenue streams reaching multiple clients simultaneously rather than relying on labor-intensive, one-to-one CSR programs. This insight influenced Gamyra's later development of SaaS products like GamyraWeb.
