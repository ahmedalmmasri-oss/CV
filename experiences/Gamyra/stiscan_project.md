# Gamyra - STISCAN Research Simulator Project

## Summary
Led development and delivery of a custom research simulator for Qatar University, managing R&D, environment creation, and client negotiations. Successfully delivered project after multiple iterative demos, securing a 4+ year ongoing maintenance contract. Provided comprehensive training to Masters and PhD researchers, later expanding relationship to include motorbike and e-scooter simulator development.

## Achievements

### Environment Development & Mapping
- **Problem:** Qatar University's research project required accurate virtual environments that didn't exist in standard simulator libraries.
- **What I Did:** Led environment development as the sole expert in Gamyra's new simulation software platform. Captured video while driving through target areas, imported GIS maps for geometric accuracy, and recreated environments with research-grade precision. Reused and optimized 3D assets from previous platforms to accelerate development.
- **Impact:** Delivered custom Qatari road environments supporting multiple research studies. Established efficient workflow for future environment creation projects, reducing development time for subsequent contracts.

### Performance Optimization & Calibration
- **Problem:** Research validity required the simulator to meet strict performance standards for vehicle dynamics, visual fidelity, and system responsiveness.
- **What I Did:** Optimized simulator performance through systematic testing and tuning. Calibrated vehicle dynamics to match real-world physics. Adjusted visual rendering to maintain high frame rates without sacrificing realism. Ensured performance met academic research standards.
- **Impact:** Delivered a simulator system that maintained research-grade performance standards throughout 4+ years of intensive use by Masters and PhD students, supporting valid scientific research outcomes.

### Client Delivery & Negotiation
- **Problem:** Client had specific requirements that evolved during development, requiring diplomatic negotiation to balance requests with technical feasibility and project scope.
- **What I Did:** Led multiple project delivery demonstrations, each incorporating client feedback. Negotiated with client to justify Gamyra's technical decisions while accommodating reasonable requests. Managed iterative approval process until achieving final sign-off.
- **Impact:** Successfully achieved project delivery approval after demonstrating responsiveness to feedback and technical expertise. Established strong client relationship leading to 4+ year ongoing maintenance contract and future expansion projects.

### Researcher Training & Support
- **Problem:** Qatar University Masters and PhD students needed to independently create scenarios, operate the simulator, and collect research data without constant Gamyra support.
- **What I Did:** Developed and delivered comprehensive training courses covering scenario development, simulator operation, and data collection workflows. Created documentation and provided ongoing technical support when researchers encountered challenges or needed advanced functionality.
- **Impact:** Empowered 10+ researchers to independently conduct studies using the simulator, accelerating their research timelines and reducing Gamyra's ongoing support burden. Training approach became template for future research client engagements.

### Software Supplier Coordination
- **Problem:** As Gamyra's sole reseller of SCANeR simulation software in Qatar, needed to coordinate directly with international supplier for technical support and feature clarification.
- **What I Did:** Conducted regular meetings with SCANeR's international development team to understand advanced features, report bugs, and request support for complex implementation challenges. Served as technical liaison between supplier and Gamyra's clients.
- **Impact:** Ensured Gamyra delivered cutting-edge simulation capabilities while maintaining strong relationship with key technology supplier. Positioned Gamyra as SCANeR's expert partner in the Middle East.

### Long-Term Client Relationship
- **Problem:** Research contracts often end after initial delivery, limiting recurring revenue opportunities.
- **What I Did:** Maintained ongoing communication with Qatar University researchers, providing responsive support and demonstrating continued value. Built trust through technical expertise and reliable service.
- **Impact:** Secured 4+ year maintenance contract providing recurring revenue. Client later requested development of motorbike and e-scooter simulators, expanding project scope and demonstrating sustained confidence in Gamyra's capabilities.

## Project Context
The STISCAN project represented Qatar University's investment in advanced driver behavior research infrastructure. The simulator supports academic research into road safety, driver psychology, and traffic engineering, contributing to Qatar's National Vision 2030 road safety goals.

## Key Achievements
- Led solo environment development on new simulation platform
- Delivered project after iterative client demos and negotiations
- Secured 4+ year ongoing maintenance contract
- Trained 10+ Masters and PhD researchers
- Expanded relationship to motorbike and e-scooter simulator projects
- Established Gamyra as regional SCANeR simulation expert
