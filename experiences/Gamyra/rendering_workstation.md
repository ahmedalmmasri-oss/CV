# Gamyra - Custom 4-GPU Rendering Workstation

## Summary
Designed and built extreme-performance 4-GPU rendering workstation for MarkOut Productions animation studio facing urgent production deadline. Overcame significant engineering challenges including thermal throttling, space constraints, and manufacturing defects to deliver system achieving top-tier benchmark performance comparable to water-cooled and open-air systems while meeting portability and low-maintenance requirements.

## Achievements

### Extreme Performance Requirements Engineering
- **Problem:** MarkOut Productions needed maximum-performance rendering station with 4 high-end GPUs, maximum RAM (128GB), high-performance CPU with robust cooling, while being portable for frequent travel/flights and requiring minimal maintenance.
- **What I Did:** Specified and sourced highest-end components internationally (cheaper than local): 4x flagship GPUs, top-tier motherboard supporting 4 GPUs at maximum bandwidth, high-performance CPU, 128GB RAM (maximum supported). Selected fully modular enclosed PC case (not open-air rack) for portability and dust protection, prioritizing air cooling over water cooling to minimize maintenance and travel complications.
- **Impact:** Met all performance requirements while satisfying unique constraints (portability, travel-friendly, low-maintenance). Built system matching specs of much larger workstation-class installations in compact, travel-ready form factor.

### Crisis Management - Component Failures
- **Problem:** PC case arrived with shattered panel; motherboard had manufacturing defect (non-functional RAM slot).
- **What I Did:** Emergency sourced replacement fully modular case locally to maintain timeline. Ordered replacement motherboard in background while continuing build process with defective board. Adapted workflow to work around RAM limitation temporarily, preparing for motherboard swap upon arrival.
- **Impact:** Maintained project timeline despite critical component failures. Demonstrated adaptability pivoting to local sourcing when international shipment failed, preventing project delay for urgent client deadline.

### Thermal Engineering & Performance Optimization
- **Problem:** 4 GPUs mounted directly to motherboard without spacing caused severe thermal throttling, preventing achievement of advertised performance despite premium components.
- **What I Did (Iteration 1):** Installed minimal rubber spacers between GPUs to create millimeter-level separation, achieving marginal performance improvement.
- **What I Did (Iteration 2):** Researched limited online resources for enclosed 4-GPU systems (most use open-air racks). Identified riser cable solution to physically separate GPUs from motherboard, enabling independent positioning for optimal airflow. Determined 2 GPUs could remain motherboard-mounted if separated by 2 empty slots; other 2 required vertical/custom mounting.
- **What I Did (Iteration 3):** Physically modified PC case by cutting ventilation holes to create custom vertical GPU mount points. Sourced and installed riser cables. Mounted 2 GPUs vertically via custom cutouts, avoiding interference with motherboard-mounted GPUs.
- **What I Did (Iteration 4):** Disassembled HDD rack to free space for 4th GPU. Found 3D printable GPU holder design mountable to case fan. 3D printed custom GPU mount, attached to floor-mounted fan, and secured final GPU in upright position with full airflow clearance.
- **Impact:** Achieved complete thermal solution with all 4 GPUs having independent airflow. Benchmark testing showed performance matching top worldwide results for similar hardware configurations, including water-cooled and open-air systems. Eliminated thermal bottleneck entirely through creative engineering.

### Performance Validation
- **Problem:** Client needed confidence system delivered advertised performance justifying premium component costs.
- **What I Did:** Conducted comprehensive benchmark testing using industry-standard tools. Compared results against worldwide performance databases for identical hardware. Validated system achieved top-tier results matching or exceeding reference systems including sophisticated cooling solutions.
- **Impact:** Delivered verifiable extreme performance meeting client requirements. System competed with water-cooled installations and open-air rack systems while maintaining portability and low-maintenance advantages.

### Long-Term Reliability Engineering
- **Problem:** System needed to operate 24/7 for multiple years with minimal maintenance despite extreme performance demands.
- **What I Did:** Prioritized enclosed case despite challenges (dust protection, reduced maintenance, travel-friendly). Implemented air cooling throughout (no water cooling requiring maintenance/leak risk). Designed optimal airflow preventing dust accumulation while maximizing thermal performance. Separated GPUs to prevent heat buildup and component degradation.
- **Impact:** System operated 24/7 for multiple years with minimal maintenance, successfully completing animation series production. Design decisions prioritizing reliability over easy installation proved correct for client's long-term use case.

### Research & Self-Directed Learning
- **Problem:** Extremely limited online resources existed for 4-GPU enclosed case configurations due to uncommon requirements (most use open racks or water cooling).
- **What I Did:** Conducted extensive research across enthusiast forums, benchmark databases, thermal engineering resources, and 3D printing communities. Synthesized knowledge from disparate sources to develop novel solution combining riser cables, case modification, and 3D-printed components.
- **Impact:** Overcame knowledge gap through self-directed research and creative problem-solving. Developed expertise in extreme-performance workstation building applicable to future client needs.

## Technical Specifications
- **GPUs:** 4x highest-end consumer GPUs (flagship models)
- **Motherboard:** Top-tier board supporting 4x GPUs at maximum bandwidth
- **CPU:** High-performance processor with robust air cooling
