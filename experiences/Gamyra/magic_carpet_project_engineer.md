# Gamyra - Magic Carpet Explore Qatar Program Engineer

## Summary
Managed Qatar's first-of-its-kind immersive educational VR program, engaging 3,741 participants over 3 years including 1,922 at Qatar Toy Festival 2024 alone. Coordinated multi-sponsor CSR program involving Qatar's leading energy companies, achieving 270% cost savings through logistics optimization. Successfully transformed program into Qatar Toy Festival's most popular activity, recovering year-behind schedule through strategic event participation.

## Achievements

### Multi-Sponsor CSR Program Management
- **Problem:** Magic Carpet program required coordinating multiple major sponsors (QatarGas, Qatar Energy, Oryx GTL, Al Khaleej Gas, Pearl GTL, Dolphin Energy) through Ras Laffan Community Outreach Program, each with distinct requirements and expectations.
- **What I Did:** Managed relationships with 6 major oil & gas sponsors. Understood each client's CSR goals and reporting requirements. Coordinated with schools across Qatar and QF to host Magic Carpet, ensuring sponsor objectives for participant numbers and community impact were met. Produced regular progress reports and impact documentation.
- **Impact:** Delivered 3,741 total participants across 3 years, meeting sponsor KPIs and maintaining multi-year funding commitments. Positioned Gamyra as reliable CSR program partner for Qatar's energy sector.

### Cost Optimization & Efficiency
- **Problem:** Initial logistics model cost 4,560 QAR per installation/move (560 QAR assembly/disassembly + 4,000 QAR transport), threatening program profitability.
- **What I Did:** Researched multiple transportation service providers and negotiated long-term contracts achieving better rates. Coordinated with Gamyra technical team to redesign Magic Carpet for faster assembly/disassembly. Streamlined processes and established reliable contractor relationships.
- **Impact:** Reduced costs to 1,680 QAR per move (480 QAR assembly + 1,200 QAR transport), achieving 63% cost reduction and 50% improved efficiency. Savings enabled program expansion and improved profitability margins.

### Qatar Toy Festival 2024 - Strategic Recovery
- **Problem:** Program fell behind 2024 targets due to Q4 2023 event cancellations (Qatar's solidarity with Gaza). Summer school downtime threatened missing annual KPIs.
- **What I Did:** Contacted Qatar Toy Festival organizers (Spacetoon partnership) on short notice to secure participation. Coordinated booth design, branding alignment (sponsors + Gamyra + venue), and security clearances with only days before event. Managed emergency logistics moving Magic Carpet between venues while coordinating assembly teams and branding contractors.
- **Impact:** Delivered 1,922 participants during Qatar Toy Festival (July-August 2024)—more than 50% of program's 3-year total in single event. Became festival's most popular activity with constant queues. Achieved 83.5% of annual target (2,504 participants) after severe Q4 2023 setback, demonstrating crisis recovery and strategic opportunism.

### Large-Scale Event Coordination
- **Problem:** Participating in major public events (Dreesha Innovation Festival during World Cup 2022, Qatar Toy Festival) required complex multi-stakeholder coordination and brand compliance.
- **What I Did:** Coordinated with Qatar Foundation and Spacetoon for event participation. Managed branding guidelines balancing sponsor requirements, Gamyra identity, and venue rules. Conducted site visits ensuring space and electrical requirements were met. Coordinated with event contractors on CAD designs and infrastructure. Contacted media outlets for event coverage. Arranged VIP sponsor/stakeholder visits and media interviews.
- **Impact:** Successfully participated in Qatar's highest-profile public events, generating media coverage and sponsor visibility. Demonstrated Gamyra's capability to execute under intense public scrutiny during World Cup 2022.

### Process Standardization & Documentation
- **Problem:** Managing dozens of school visits and public events required systematic approach to avoid missed details and ensure quality consistency.
- **What I Did:** Standardized event management processes using Monday.com. Created comprehensive school database with contact persons, communication tracking, booking forms, and proposal templates. Labeled schools by communication stage (introduction, sent proposal, site visit, confirmed). Automated follow-up reminders. Tracked participant numbers and media files for each event.
- **Impact:** Scaled program to dozens of events annually without missing commitments or losing quality. Created reusable system adopted for other Gamyra programs, improving organizational efficiency across company.

### Product Development Support
- **Problem:** Magic Carpet needed iterative improvements based on user feedback before broader deployment.
- **What I Did:** Supported development team through quality assurance and bug testing. Organized QSTP community beta testing event, coordinating with QSTP Communications on event brochure, RSVP management, and booking coordination. Managed feedback collection from children and parents, documenting improvements before school and public event launches. Hired Research Analyst to kick-start next Magic Carpet experience development.
- **Impact:** Improved product quality before wide release, reducing issues during high-profile events. Collected valuable user insights informing future experience development.

### Team Development
- **Problem:** Program growth required additional trained staff to manage events independently.
- **What I Did:** Interviewed new hires, assessing fit with company requirements. Trained operators on system operation, event handling, and contractor coordination. Created training materials and supervised initial events until operators were independent.
- **Impact:** Scaled program delivery capacity while reducing dependency on senior staff, enabling simultaneous events and reducing labor costs through appropriately-leveled staffing.
