# Gamyra - Project Engineer, Students for Road Safety Program

## Summary
Managed the final two years of Qatar's largest road safety campaign, Students for Road Safety (SFRS), which engaged tens of thousands of participants from 2013-2019. Led strategic planning with government sponsors, coordinated nationwide school visits, and produced bilingual client reports and press releases. SFRS demonstrated 83% improvement in road safety knowledge among participants who experienced one-to-one simulator training.

## Achievements

### Strategic Program Management
- **Problem:** SFRS needed coordinated execution across multiple stakeholders including the Traffic Department, program sponsors, and dozens of schools to maintain its position as Qatar's premier road safety campaign.
- **What I Did:** Led quarterly strategy meetings with Qatar's Traffic Department and program sponsors to set annual objectives and plan campaign events. Developed event calendars, allocated resources, and ensured alignment between government goals and educational outcomes.
- **Impact:** Successfully managed 2 years of Qatar's most impactful road safety program, contributing to the overall campaign achievement of 50+ school visits and 14,000+ one-to-one simulator training sessions since program inception.

### Educational Institution Coordination
- **Problem:** Scheduling and coordinating visits across Qatar Foundation schools, independent schools, and universities required diplomatic negotiation and logistical precision.
- **What I Did:** Established relationships with decision-makers at Qatar Foundation and independent schools. Coordinated visit schedules that accommodated school calendars, event logistics, and program targets. Managed the deployment of Range Rover Evoque-based driving simulators featuring 20+ km of recreated Doha roads.
- **Impact:** Maintained SFRS's reach across Qatar's diverse educational landscape, ensuring 42% Qatari youth participation and balanced coverage across public, independent, and international schools.

### Bilingual Communications & Reporting
- **Problem:** Stakeholders required professional documentation in both Arabic and English to communicate program impact to government entities, sponsors, and media.
- **What I Did:** Produced comprehensive client reports detailing participation metrics, learning outcomes, and program statistics. Wrote press releases in Arabic and English for distribution to local and regional media outlets.
- **Impact:** Enhanced program visibility and sponsor satisfaction through professional communications. Documentation supported funding renewals and demonstrated measurable impact (83% knowledge improvement among simulator participants).

### Immersive Training Delivery
- **Problem:** Traditional road safety education through presentations wasn't creating lasting behavioral change among young drivers.
- **What I Did:** Managed the delivery of one-to-one driving simulator sessions using Gamyra's high-fidelity systems featuring full Range Rover Evoque cockpits. Participants experienced dangerous scenarios like distracted drivers and tire blowouts in completely safe environments.
- **Impact:** Delivered engaging, experiential learning that achieved 83% improvement in road safety knowledge, far exceeding traditional presentation-only approaches. Trained thousands of young drivers in realistic scenarios before they encountered them on real roads.

## Program Context
SFRS operated from 2013-2019 as Qatar's most ambitious road safety initiative, sponsored by leading Qatari organizations. The program combined interactive presentations with cutting-edge simulator training to address Qatar's road safety challenges, where traffic accidents remain the leading cause of premature death.
