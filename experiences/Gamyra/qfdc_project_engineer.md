# Gamyra - QF Driving Club Project Engineer

## Summary
Launched and managed QF Driving Club, a first-of-its-kind road safety center within Qatar Foundation, delivering 2,344 one-to-one training sessions over 3 years. Overcame significant organizational and logistical challenges during COVID-19 and World Cup 2022, restructuring program delivery model to achieve client goals. Successfully established long-term presence within QF's ecosystem through diplomatic stakeholder management.

## Achievements

### Program Launch & Stakeholder Coordination
- **Problem:** Launching a permanent road safety center within Qatar Foundation—a large, complex organization—required convincing multiple stakeholders to support a completely new approach to HSE goals.
- **What I Did:** Presented QF Driving Club concept to QF Executives and Directors, demonstrating alignment with safety objectives. Coordinated across QF Communications, QF HSE, QF Public Utility & Environment Directors, QF Events, and QF Recreation facilities to secure buy-in. Identified optimal center location meeting program requirements and coordinated facility setup.
- **Impact:** Successfully established QF's first permanent road safety center in 2022, creating sustainable infrastructure for long-term youth engagement rather than one-time campaigns. Secured multi-year sponsorship supporting operations through 2024 with potential extension to 2030.

### Logistics Crisis Management
- **Problem:** COVID-19 restrictions and World Cup 2022 preparations forced early school closure just weeks after QFDC's late 2022 launch, leaving minimal time to demonstrate value. Schools refused to send students across roads for 8-10 minute sessions (5 students/hour), citing safety concerns and operational burden.
- **What I Did:** Completely restructured program delivery model to bring the driving simulator to each school. Coordinated assembly/disassembly teams, logistics companies, and security clearances across multiple QF schools. Created efficient scheduling system managing transitions between venues while controlling costs. Developed school-specific schedules accommodating each school's policies (PE class prioritization, group sizes, student tracking sheets).
- **Impact:** Transformed potential program failure into operational success. Maintained client relationship and achieved participation targets despite severe early setbacks. Restructured delivery model became standard approach, enabling broader school coverage across QF.

### Relationship Recovery & Conflict Resolution
- **Problem:** Newton School (one of Qatar's largest with 12 branches) had stored simulator during summer with promise of fall program, but sponsor unexpectedly requested simulator for Doha Quest employee event.
- **What I Did:** Negotiated diplomatically with school contact, explaining situation and promising simulator return within days plus additional program for another Newton branch as goodwill gesture. Coordinated complex logistics moving simulator from school → Doha Quest → back to school while maintaining trust.
- **Impact:** Retained relationship with Newton School (12 branches), securing future program expansions rather than losing major client partner. Demonstrated commitment to promises even when facing conflicting sponsor demands.

### Risk Assessment & Compliance
- **Problem:** Establishing permanent center within Qatar Foundation required comprehensive safety and operational risk documentation.
- **What I Did:** Prepared detailed Risk Assessment documents meeting QF standards. Coordinated with designers to create room designs and artwork compliant with both sponsor brand guidelines and QF facility requirements.
- **Impact:** Achieved QF safety and compliance approval, enabling program operations within Qatar Foundation's stringent standards. Established credibility for future QF collaborations.

### Client Reporting & Communications
- **Problem:** Sponsors and QF stakeholders required ongoing visibility into program performance and impact.
- **What I Did:** Created comprehensive event reports shared with sponsors and stakeholders. Wrote and coordinated press releases. Arranged VIP events celebrating milestones, involving QF, QSTP, and media for stakeholder/sponsor interviews.
- **Impact:** Maintained sponsor satisfaction and funding continuity through transparent reporting. Generated positive media coverage enhancing program visibility and Gamyra's reputation.

### Throughput Optimization
- **Problem:** Schools sometimes struggled to maintain consistent student flow, threatening program efficiency and client KPI achievement.
- **What I Did:** Sat with each school to develop customized schedules (PE class rotations, teacher-managed sign-up sheets, student tracking via Google Sheets). Created live scoring systems enabling class-vs-class competition. Adapted to school preferences (groups of 5 vs. groups of 2, badge-passing systems).
- **Impact:** Maximized simulator utilization while respecting each school's unique constraints. Achieved 2,344 sessions over 3 years despite operational complexity, meeting sponsor targets and justifying program continuation.
