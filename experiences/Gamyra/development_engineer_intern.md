# Gamyra - Development Engineer Intern

## Summary
Developed Qatar's first comprehensive 3D road environment for driver behavior research at Qatar University. Led the technical development of a 6km replica of Doha's road network, mastering proprietary simulation software while delivering custom traffic scenarios. Successfully commissioned multiple driving simulators at client sites, receiving a performance bonus and appreciation letter for exceptional learning and delivery speed.

## Achievements

### 3D Virtual Environment Development
- **Problem:** Qatar University required an accurate 3D replica of Doha's road environment for driver behavior research on a brand-new simulation platform unfamiliar to Gamyra.
- **What I Did:** Led the development of a 6km 3D road environment using SCANeR simulation software. Captured video footage while driving through target areas, imported GIS maps for accurate road geometry from multiple perspectives, and recreated Doha's roads with high fidelity. Learned the new software independently and reused 3D assets from previous simulation platforms.
- **Impact:** Successfully delivered Qatar University's first research-grade driving simulator with a custom Doha environment. Became Gamyra's sole expert in the new simulation platform, positioning the company to expand into research-focused projects.

### Custom Traffic Behavior Programming
- **Problem:** Research scenarios required realistic and controllable traffic behaviors that didn't exist in standard simulation libraries.
- **What I Did:** Developed custom traffic behaviors and driving scenarios using the simulation software's proprietary scripting language. Identified and reported software bugs to the international software provider, collaborating directly with their technical team.
- **Impact:** Enabled Qatar University researchers to conduct controlled experiments with realistic Qatari traffic patterns, supporting multiple Masters and PhD research projects.

### Simulator Commissioning & Client Support
- **Problem:** Four driving simulators needed to be tested, commissioned, and delivered to driving academies with tight deadlines.
- **What I Did:** Supported the engineering team throughout the testing and commissioning process. Participated in client meetings, technical discussions, and brainstorming sessions. Ensured each simulator met performance standards before delivery.
- **Impact:** Successfully commissioned and delivered 4 driving simulators to client sites. Gained exposure to client relationship management and technical project delivery.

### Performance Optimization
- **Problem:** Simulator performance needed to meet strict standards for research validity.
- **What I Did:** Optimized simulator performance through systematic testing and calibration. Ensured graphics, physics, and responsiveness met research-grade requirements.
- **Impact:** Delivered a simulator system that maintained performance standards throughout years of intensive research use, supporting ongoing academic studies.

## Recognition
Received a performance bonus and official appreciation letter from Gamyra for rapidly mastering new technology and delivering high-quality work ahead of schedule during the internship period.
